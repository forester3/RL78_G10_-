# led_blink2 project  
This is second sample project.  
LED works blinking 1Hz at pin 11(port 0.2).  
You can connect LED through  around 1k ohm from 5V.  
This sample works reset voltage at 4.2V.  
## Updates
This works external ceramic resonator(20MHz).  
Brinking LED works on timer resource, but not using interrupts.
